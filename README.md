# LetsMultiply
The goal is to build an “edutainment” app for kids to help them practice multiplication tables – “what is 7 x 8?” and so on. Edutainment apps are educational at their code, but ideally have enough playfulness about them to make kids want to play. This app is a challenge of 100 Days of SwiftUI so the whole app is made with SwiftUI
